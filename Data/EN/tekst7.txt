Pickeral is the daughter of veterinary surgeon John Hughes MRCVS and artist/art teacher Valorie Jervis (née Rochfort-Hyde; granddaughter to Gustavus Rochfort Wade, High Sheriff of Westmeath, Éire[4] ), and was brought up in an environment that greatly influenced her later career. Following school she won a scholarship to study history of art in Italy,[5] before entering Reading University, Berks to study history of art and architecture. Throughout her school and university years, Pickeral rode horses competitively, eventing and showjumping in her free time with some success.[6] Horses have continued to play a significant role in her life.[7]
After graduating from university with an honours degree in the history of art and architecture, Pickeral travelled extensively, partially funded through the sale of a horse. On her return to the UK she worked for a short period of time in the travel industry, based in London, which indirectly led to a trip to Wyoming,[8] USA. Pickeral married and remained in the US for eight years, spending the majority of this time living in relative isolation on a cattle ranch.
