The term unit load refers to the size of an assemblage into which a number of individual items are combined for ease of storage and handling,[1] for example a pallet load represents a unit load which can be moved easily with a pallet jack or forklift truck, or a container load represents a unit for shipping purposes. A unit load can be packed tightly into a warehouse rack, intermodal container, truck or boxcars, yet can be easily broken apart at a distribution point, usually a distribution center, wholesaler, or retail store for sale to consumers or for use.
wo elements are found in the illustrations of the emaki: people indoors engaging in activities typical of the aristocracy of the period, such as writing letters, playing instruments, exchanging poems or talking to each other; and the gardens outside their buildings. For this reason, Mason calls the people in the emaki "house bound".[15][16] The leftward direction of scroll reading is reflected in the composition of paintings and pictures which may build to a climax from right to left; or a main event presented on the right may be followed by its after-effects to the left.[17] Stylistically the emaki follows the principles of the onna-e genre of yamato-e and is in this respect similar to the Tale of Genji Scrolls (1120â€“1140) but differs from them in many other aspects.[1][11][18][19] Typical for onna-e, the paintings depict life at the palace with a sense of nostalgia, timeless and very retained, but purely decorative elements such as landscapes and contemplative scenes are added.[20] Illustrations are relatively short compared to emaki of war or folktales,[nb 3] which according to Mason, "heightens the symbolic quality of non-figural motifs".[17]
The painting technique of tsukuri-e ("built painting"), used mainly in emaki of the court in the 12th century, is also used here.[2] It is done in three stages: a first sketch of the scene is made with Indian ink (probably by a master of the workshop), then the color is applied on the entire surface of the paper in a specific order, from large areas in the background to fine details. Finally, the contours are enhanced or revived in ink to emphasize the depth.[21] However, a visible change in style may again be noted, because the pigments are here less opaque than usual, and the more subtle shades are highlighted by fine outlines in ink; and in addition, the decorative aspect emerges strongly through extensive use of gold dust, and sometimes of silver.[2] According to Mason, the technique seems to be less careful than in the past, as can be seen in elements of the architectural interior (such as sliding doors and screens) which lack detail or in the silver powder which is used much less often in general compared to gold.
The cultural changes after the Heian period resulted in a more realistic depiction of figures including movements and gestures.[7] Abandoning the Heian period hikime kagibana ("slit eyes, hooked nose") style,[nb 4] figures were painted individual features and facial expressions that conveyed emotions and moods.[5][17][20] More generally, M. Murase notes that the expression of feelings subtly changed compared to the scrolls of the 12th century; here the rooms (or the inner space, because it depends on the fusuma) in the palace are larger and less intimate or private, and nobles come and go naturally and determined.[11] Unlike earlier scrolls such as the Genji Emaki, in which architecture and landscape were used as metaphors for people's emotions, interpersonal or societal pressures, in these scrolls the people's feelings are painted directly on the faces or shown through gestures, in addition to being expressed by the placement of characters within the scene. Architectural elements such as pillars, beams or platforms continued to be used to convey moods. Landscapes stand on their own as they are detached from the characters' emotions and gain a new function as a place to escape from the constraints of court life.[4][7][17]
Like most emaki, the composition is based on the fukinuki yatai ("blown-off roof") technique, which consists of a perspective of looking down from above into the inner spaces resulting in a plunging view. Furthermore, diagonals are used to mark depth. Compared to earlier scrolls, in these scrolls, the interior spaces are depicted from a more normal perspective such as through rolled up bamboo blinds (misu)[nb 5]) or spaces in the walls where sliding panels (fusuma) had been removed.[17] The pace that is intentionally slow in tsukuri-e, here seems slightly faster with illustrations depicting a single occurrence in time and temporally related events positioned close to each other in the emaki.[7][22]
